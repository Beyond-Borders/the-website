                  <em>Dark purple signifies, according to color psychology, warmth. We want people to feel welcome at our service.</em>

                  <em>Broken white was chosen because it feels friendlier than white. It can be seen as a combination of white and yellow, which would mean competence, happiness and sincerity due to color psychology.</em>

                  #7DDE92
                  <em>Light green signifies, according to color psychology, health and money amongst others. We mainly added this color to the palette due to the friendly vibe it gives.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices</strong>
             <ul>
                <li><em>In Social Media posts, made through Canva:</em> Dreaming Outloud Sans for headings and Canva Sans for the body text. Due to unavailability for use on the website we found alternatives that fit closely with the original font.</li>
                <li><em>In the website:</em> Verveine for headings, designed by Luce Averous, retrieved from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/verveine">Adobe Fonts</a> and New Atten Regular for the bodies of text, designed by Miles Newlyn, retrieved from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/new-atten">Adobe Fonts.</a></li>
                <li>We chose these fonts for the headings because it looks more like handwriting, and we want to convey approachability, this font helps in that because it feels less strict and formal. For the body font we chose something that is easily readable for everyone.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

           <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cards - 11x - This was used across the website for multiple purposes. On the <a href="funding.html">funding page</a> it worked well as a way to seperate the different Tiers easily and neatly. For the <a href="about_us.html">team aspect</a> it was also a nice way to give all three of us a nice space that grabbed attention in which we are introduced and for the <a href=index.html>front page</a> it makes clear that we have three different sections in which we would provide guidance.</li>
                  <li>Carousel - 1x - We picked this because photos engage people more than simply text and drawings. This was a nice way to both have an attractive element in the website as well as showing the other pages we have. Getting to use photos is a pro that came with it. Can be found at <a href="index.html">the home page</a>.</li>
                  <li>Two column - 1x - We used this because the info we wanted to display didn't need the very visible seperation, thus the columns worked really well. You can find this one at the <a href="about_us.html">about us</a> page.</li>
                  <li>Popover - 5x - For the sponsorship part we had to figure out a way that could display someone donating. We eventually chose to use popovers to show they donated after clicking the button, as we don't use actual donations. You can find this on the <a href="funding.html">funding page</a> and by clicking on any of the donate buttons.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>The structure of the navigation and content</strong></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>We chose to use multiple pages, because that divides different aspects nicer. If it's all on one page it can be more overwhelming, it's nice to have seperate pages for seperate things.</li>
                  <li>Home page - We start with text welcoming them to the Netherlands, our logo and the cards of what we offer. We chose to put this first to make clear what we want to do and what we'd offer, and that it's for the Netherlands. After that a carousel follows that provides them with buttons with which they can go to the other pages.</li>
                  <li>About us page - Here we start with introducing the brand more, as that is what our visitors are coming for. We give them the vision and values as well as the contact info. At the bottom we introduce the team.</li>
                  <li>Funding page - This is the page where we ask people to donate. We start with the logo again and a little bit of text before we show the Tier cards.</li>

          <h3 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h3>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
          
          <p>We wanted to show expats that they are not alone and they shouldn't be scared of the moving and the transition process because we will help them. They should feel confident when coming to the Netherlands and know that they are taken care of. Beyond Borders is a brand that provides comfort, security and support.</p>

          <p>We decided to use Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook as the main platforms on which to promote our brand. Instagram and LinkedIn in particular are very popular amongst millennials as well as Gen-Z <a href="https://www.webmarketingpros.com/study-shows-why-teens-and-young-adults-love-instagram/">(Roesler, 2015)</a>. Gen Z is having an increase in LinkedIn users, as the generation is growing older and needs to start building networks for their professional careers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/13/linkedin-gen-z-social-media-revival">(Ball, 2022)</a>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram - A commonly used social media platform, good at engaging the consumers. Instagram focuses on high quality visual consumer experience which is why this platform is among the most used ones when it comes to promoting</p>
            <li>LinkedIn - Internationals are actively using this platform to find housing or look for answers of their questions</p>
            <li>Facebook - This platform is used by its consumers to help them track important businesses and events they could be interested in or find useful</p>
          </ul>    

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During this project we learned a lot when it comes to properly marketing a brand. Having to do it in reality and not only on paper made us learn faster and pinpoint the mistakes way easier. We decided to promote our brand on three different platforms - Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn. Even though all the platforms were useful in helping us reach our taget audience, these were our biggest learning points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Facebook and LinkedIn were growing much slower than Instagram. When Instagram had a reach of 30-41 in the first 4 posts, Facebook and LinkedIn had a reach of 0-9. Therefore, we focused more on Instagram but <strong>we learned that with the right strategy other platfroms can be effective as well.</strong> Because a Reel on Facebook was more successful than on Instagram because it reached 476 people.</li>
            <li>Understanding how Facebook works was quite hard and complicated. Using Facebook was more complicated than using other platforms, so we had to learn how to properly use Facebook and create a business acount.</li>
            <li>Posting only pictures with illustrations is <strong>not engaging enough</strong>. We started by posting simples posts with illustrations but it wasn't engaging enough therefore, we tried postings Reels to keep our viewers interested. We also tried putting the most important information on the post itself and not only underneath the post. This is when we noticed our reach increasing.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalised content has a bigger reach</strong> (by 33%). We made a post with the picture of our team and this was our most successful post which on Instagram had a reach of 91. This showed that our audience prefers more personalised content and not only illustrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency is Key.</strong> It is important to post consistently and not just one day per week but to really stick to your planning to see the results.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p> Future recommendations if the campaign would be continued  based on our experience during this project:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After a few weeks of marketing our brand on Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn, we realized that Facebook was the least effective for our brand, however in the future we would put more time into creating a strategy for Facebook and use various Facebook groups and ads to reach bigger audience.</li>
            <li>We would  post four times a week instead of three in order to get bigger reach as well as post on different times to check which timing is the best one.</li>
            <li>We didn't make use of Instagram and Facebook stories therefore, in the future we would also post on stories to be more interactive and engaging.</li>
            <li>Rather than posting the same content on every platform, we  would customise it because we noticed that content that is a great fit for Instagram might not be perfect for LinkedIn and it requires a different approach.</li>
            <li>Using not only social media but creating a marketing campaign would expand our possibilities every further. We would collaborate with different universities in the Netherlands and join their open days to promot our service.</li>
            <li>Research has shown that YouTube is a very popular platform amongst our target audience so we would also make use of that and advertise our brand on this platform.</li>
