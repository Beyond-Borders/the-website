              <strong>The colour palette</strong> (the color psychology refers to the Adobe XD cards that were provided to us in the lectures):
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #fb6107;"></span>
                  #fb6107
                  <em>The bright orange colour refers to the Netherlands and the colour of Dutch people.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #4E4187;"></span>
                  #4E4187
                  <em>Dark purple signifies, according to color psychology, warmth. We want people to feel welcome at our service.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #3083DC;"></span>
                  #3083DC
                  <em>Light blue signifies, according to color psychology, competence, reliability and high quality.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F8FFE5;"></span>
                  #F8FFE5
                  <em>Broken white was chosen because it feels friendlier than white. It can be seen as a combination of white and yellow, which would mean competence, happiness and sincerity due to color psychology.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #7DDE92;"></span>
                  #7DDE92
                  <em>Light green signifies, according to color psychology, health and money amongst others. We mainly added this color to the palette due to the friendly vibe it gives.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices</strong>
             <ul>
                <li><em>In Social Media posts, made through Canva:</em> Dreaming Outloud Sans for headings and Canva Sans for the body text. Due to unavailability for use on the website we found alternatives that fit closely with the original font.</li>
                <li><em>In the website:</em> Verveine for headings, designed by Luce Averous, retrieved from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/verveine">Adobe Fonts</a> and New Atten Regular for the bodies of text, designed by Miles Newlyn, retrieved from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/new-atten">Adobe Fonts.</a></li>
                <li>We chose these fonts for the headings because it looks more like handwriting, and we want to convey approachability, this font helps in that because it feels less strict and formal. For the body font we chose something that is easily readable for everyone.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

           <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cards - 11x - This was used across the website for multiple purposes. On the <a href="funding.html">funding page</a> it worked well as a way to seperate the different Tiers easily and neatly. For the <a href="about_us.html">team aspect</a> it was also a nice way to give all three of us a nice space that grabbed attention in which we are introduced and for the <a href=index.html>front page</a> it makes clear that we have three different sections in which we would provide guidance.</li>
                  <li>Carousel - 1x - We picked this because photos engage people more than simply text and drawings. This was a nice way to both have an attractive element in the website as well as showing the other pages we have. Getting to use photos is a pro that came with it. Can be found at <a href="index.html">the home page</a>.</li>
                  <li>Two column - 1x - We used this because the info we wanted to display didn't need the very visible seperation, thus the columns worked really well. You can find this one at the <a href="about_us.html">about us</a> page.</li>
                  <li>Popover - 5x - For the sponsorship part we had to figure out a way that could display someone donating. We eventually chose to use popovers to show they donated after clicking the button, as we don't use actual donations. You can find this on the <a href="funding.html">funding page</a> and by clicking on any of the donate buttons.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>The structure of the navigation and content</strong></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>We chose to use multiple pages, because that divides different aspects nicer. If it's all on one page it can be more overwhelming, it's nice to have seperate pages for seperate things.</li>
                  <li>Home page - We start with text welcoming them to the Netherlands, our logo and the cards of what we offer. We chose to put this first to make clear what we want to do and what we'd offer, and that it's for the Netherlands. After that a carousel follows that provides them with buttons with which they can go to the other pages.</li>
                  <li>About us page - Here we start with introducing the brand more, as that is what our visitors are coming for. We give them the vision and values as well as the contact info. At the bottom we introduce the team.</li>
                  <li>Funding page - This is the page where we ask people to donate. We start with the logo again and a little bit of text before we show the Tier cards.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Justifications website design in relation to other sections.</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Due to the fact that we went for the 'best friend in the Netherlands' side, we implemented that in the visual identity of our brand and implemented that in the website. The friendly shapes, colours and font provide the feeling of our brand's personality.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The website design fits because on all pages you are able to find links to the social media accounts and mail. Aside of that, the visuals of our website match with the content on our socials.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>All the questions of expats would be answered through the website, and only the website. That's what makes it unique.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <p>For proof of testing refer to Appendix 1.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Testing <strong>goals</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>To find the weak spots in our website and change it for the better.</li>
                <li>To find out how easy it is for the users to work with the website.</li>
                <li>To gain insight into what can be improved.</li>
                <li>To collect some creative ideas from the users themselves.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Testing <strong>methods</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Our test participants all fit our target audience criteria. They are students, some of which also working, between the ages of 20 and 25 years old. All students are from different nationalities – German, American and Bulgarian. </li>
                <li>The testing was done on campus, on the laptop from one of our team. Three students were interviewed and tested.</li>
                <li>The students were given three main tasks – to find our brand’s values, check how they can sponsor us if they want to and find the team page. They were also left to explore the website on their own and asked a couple of questions regarding the design and simplicity of the layout. They were recorded by phone during the testing.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Testing <strong>results</strong>
              <ul>
              <li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>In order to see what the brand is about the testers had to scroll down which was not very convenient.</li>
                <li>It isn’t clear that it is for expats right from the start.</li>
                <li>One tester mentioned that it is quite difficult to understand that our brand is based in the Netherlands.</li>
                <li>It is very clear and simple which makes the website easier to use.</li>
                <li>It might appear to plain and simple for some people.</li>
                <li>The green color makes it seem like it’s an eco-friendly brand or a brand that has something to do with saving the planet.</li>
              </ul>

              <li>Improvements</li>
              <ul>
                <li>We changed the colours and illustrations to make it more cheerful and engaging, while staying true to our visual identity.</li>
                <li>We changed the positioning of our content a bit in order to begin with an explanation of what we provide and what our brand is about.</li>
                <li>We changed the green color to yellow because the green was reminding them of an eco website.</li>
                <li>We mentioned that our brand is based in the Netherlands.</li>
              </ul>

          <p>We wanted to show expats that they are not alone and they shouldn't be scared of the moving and the transition process because we will help them. They should feel confident when coming to the Netherlands and know that they are taken care of. Beyond Borders is a brand that provides comfort, security and support.</p>
          <p>We posted three times a week per platform, Instagram and Facebook on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 12am. LinkedIn on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 10am.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reach objectives:</strong> Increased brand awareness measured by Instagram profile visits which are going to reach 200 people per week, by the end of 14th of April, 2023.</li>
            <li><strong>Affect objectives:</strong> By the end of 14th of April 2023, we will get positive feedback from 3 people which indicates that they are interested in the brand and it's service.</li>
            <li><strong>Response objectives:</strong> By the end of 14th of April 2023, at least 1 person will contact us and ask for our help on documentations.</li>
            <li><strong>What do you want to achieve?</strong> We want to increase our brand awareness by actively using social media and trying different ways to reach our target audience. We want to clearly convey the feelings of the brand and the purpose that's going to help a number of people feel that they belong in this new country and make their transition smoother. By the end 2023 we want to be known by at least 50 loyal clients that are interested and trust us to help them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We decided to use Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook as the main platforms on which to promote our brand. Instagram and LinkedIn in particular are very popular amongst millennials as well as Gen-Z <a href="https://www.webmarketingpros.com/study-shows-why-teens-and-young-adults-love-instagram/">(Roesler, 2015)</a>. Gen Z is having an increase in LinkedIn users, as the generation is growing older and needs to start building networks for their professional careers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/13/linkedin-gen-z-social-media-revival">(Ball, 2022)</a>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram - A commonly used social media platform, good at engaging the consumers. Instagram focuses on high quality visual consumer experience which is why this platform is among the most used ones when it comes to promoting</p>
            <li>LinkedIn - Internationals are actively using this platform to find housing or look for answers of their questions</p>
            <li>Facebook - This platform is used by its consumers to help them track important businesses and events they could be interested in or find useful</p>
          </ul>    

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During this project we learned a lot when it comes to properly marketing a brand. Having to do it in reality and not only on paper made us learn faster and pinpoint the mistakes way easier. We decided to promote our brand on three different platforms - Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn. Even though all the platforms were useful in helping us reach our taget audience, these were our biggest learning points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Facebook and LinkedIn were growing much slower than Instagram. When Instagram had a reach of 30-41 in the first 4 posts, Facebook and LinkedIn had a reach of 0-9. Therefore, we focused more on Instagram but <strong>we learned that with the right strategy other platfroms can be effective as well.</strong> Because a Reel on Facebook was more successful than on Instagram because it reached 476 people.</li>
            <li>Understanding how Facebook works was quite hard and complicated. Using Facebook was more complicated than using other platforms, so we had to learn how to properly use Facebook and create a business acount.</li>
            <li>Posting only pictures with illustrations is <strong>not engaging enough</strong>. We started by posting simples posts with illustrations but it wasn't engaging enough therefore, we tried postings Reels to keep our viewers interested. We also tried putting the most important information on the post itself and not only underneath the post. This is when we noticed our reach increasing.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalised content has a bigger reach</strong> (by 33%). We made a post with the picture of our team and this was our most successful post which on Instagram had a reach of 91. This showed that our audience prefers more personalised content and not only illustrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency is Key.</strong> It is important to post consistently and not just one day per week but to really stick to your planning to see the results.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p> Future recommendations if the campaign would be continued  based on our experience during this project:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After a few weeks of marketing our brand on Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn, we realized that Facebook was the least effective for our brand, however in the future we would put more time into creating a strategy for Facebook and use various Facebook groups and ads to reach bigger audience.</li>
            <li>We would  post four times a week instead of three in order to get bigger reach as well as post on different times to check which timing is the best one.</li>
            <li>We didn't make use of Instagram and Facebook stories therefore, in the future we would also post on stories to be more interactive and engaging.</li>
            <li>Rather than posting the same content on every platform, we  would customise it because we noticed that content that is a great fit for Instagram might not be perfect for LinkedIn and it requires a different approach.</li>
            <li>Using not only social media but creating a marketing campaign would expand our possibilities every further. We would collaborate with different universities in the Netherlands and join their open days to promot our service.</li>
            <li>Research has shown that YouTube is a very popular platform amongst our target audience so we would also make use of that and advertise our brand on this platform.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Beyond Borders is a brand made for Expats to make their transition to the Netherlands as smooth as possible. We understand that moving to another country can be very exciting but it also requires a lot of paperwork and stress. You not only need to move your belongings to a new country but also your  documents like insurance, registration, working visa and so on... And it can be quite confusing to understand new rules and regulations in a new country, therefore we are here to help! Expats can use our service to ask questions, to get help for understanding any paperwork or we can even do it for them, we provide personalised checklist and even personal assistants.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Our brand is all about helping expats with the documentations ann any questions they have when moving to the Netherlands. We knew that we dont want to be a complicated andvery official brand but rather give a friendly, welcoming and securing feeling. That's why our logo has a heart and two hands with warm, bright colours to immediately make people want to contact us and feel welcome to do so. We want to be their best friend is helping with anything they need with easily understandable information and format. That's why we are different from other brands that are similar to ours. We provide a bigger variety of service at one place so expats don't have to use multiple media channels. There is a brand called 'Expat Help' and they provide help with housing, relocation and migration, however we offer a bigger variety of services and questions that we can answer and help with.</p>
